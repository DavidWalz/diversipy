This module contains algorithms for the task of subset selection: suppose
you have a set of points in :math:`\\mathbb{R}^n` and want to select a sample
of them distributed as uniform as possible. This problem is related to
clustering, with the difference that when using clustering, you usually want
to retain the structure of the original point set.

        If provided, it is called as ``callback(indices, dists)`` in each
        iteration for monitoring progress. ``indices`` is the current set
        of selected indices and ``dists`` are the current distances. It
        holds that ``indices[-1] == argmin(dists)``.
